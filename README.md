Webstackers come from many different languages, stacks, and backgrounds; but we are all passionate about web development and code. With this meetup our goal is to bring us together for an evening and bring those passions to the surface. We have a variety of things we like to do, ranging from formal presentations to open hack nights. However, it's always fun, and you are almost always guaranteed to meet like-minded people here.

We organize our events via Meetup, so for information on the latest event, [check here](https://www.meetup.com/TucsonJS/).

## About This Repo
Shameless promotion aside, this repo is meant to collect information on past and future meetups. Ill outline how that works.

### Past Meetups
Meetups are organized by year and month, with each event having its own little readme. The readme will have a brief description of the meetup (including any topics covered), links to any resources mentioned, and (if possible) links to presentations/recordings.

### Future Meetups
Topics for future meetups are submitted by opening an [issue](https://github.com/webstackers/meetup/issues) on this repo. Pretty much any web development topic is welcome as long as you follow the few guidelines outlined here.

* Please provide a working title and a short description. Nothing super detailed is needed, just enough to get the point across.
* Keep it PG13-ish. We are all adults but we don't want topics uncomfortable to talk about.
* One topic per issue please. If you end up coming up with more through conversation, pop them out into new issues.
* Topics are picked based on thumbs. The topics with the most thumbs up will be move forward in the process. [How to Add Reactions to Issues](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
* Interactions inside this repo should follow our [code of conduct](http://coc.webstackers.org/).
